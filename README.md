# CALIFORNIA HOUSING DATASET
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the California housing dataset then after that I am doing classification on it by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. predicting median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.
